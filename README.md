# 3rd-p-Equipment
Update and partial rewrite of grasman's [Third Person Equipment Mod](https://github.com/Vermintide-Mod-Framework/Grasmann-Mods/tree/master/third_person_equipment) for Vermintide 2.

Description :
Shows your equipment on your character.
Melee- and ranged weapon as well as tomes, grims, potions, bombs, heal items and equipped trinket are visible on yourself, bots and teammates.
Display of Pick-up-items optional. Toggle anytime via mod-menu.


Original idea and code by grasmann, update, partial rewrite and new functionality by dalo_kraff and kunigundeh.

### To do:
- [x] More emotes mod (ScakicPL) -compatibility (filter for emote-name-string and set visibility false for wielded weapon accordingly) (Remember: remove 'emote' from special states-list for showcase/release/use, keep it in for placement-adjusting!!!)
- [x] Implement User-choice for showing pick-up items (filter for slots based on mod-menu-setting)
- [ ] Implement exception for dual-shield-visibility (grailknight, warrior-priest)
- [ ] Implement same weapon handling for slayer, grailknight, warrior-priest(?)
- [ ] Implement handling for javelins (visible right-hand-/ammo-unit)
